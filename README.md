Hi there, <br>
<br>
Are you looking for someone who could assist you to provide a high-quality of websites? <br>
<br>
My name is Emik and I'm passionate about quality. I believe quality is not just about the product but also the experience. As a software tester, I will do my best to ensure that the products are high-quality and meet the customer's needs. <br>
<br>
Allow me to began this journey, to implement this knowledge into real-life experiences. Not only do manual testing, but I'm also could do automation testing using Katalon Studio, Cypress and mobile automation testing for android using appium. To make its stronger, I have passed the CTFL certification by ISTQB. Five-years of experience in HR bring a strong business background and might be a perfect addition to your team, be a unique and broaden the testing perspective.<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
Emik Adiani
